Statuto

Statuto is a note-taking, reminder, and priority setting application that is easy to use and with an attractive interface. This project was prepared in carrying out work on the AOL (Assurance of Learning) final project in the Human Computer Interaction course. This work is organized with the approach of working on an application development project with a front end development approach. This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application development project creates a notepad where we can set the priority scale. In addition, there are also alarms and reminders when the dateline of a job has been completed.
